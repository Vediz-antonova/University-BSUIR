Hello, this is a sample text for testing regex patterns. 
Are you ready to see the analysis results? 
Wow! Incredible performance in text analysis! 
This text includes many aspects: uppercase letters like ABCXYZ, valid smileys such as :---((( and ;-[[[, and also some invalid ones like :-- and ;[). 
Moreover, observe the sequence aaaabbbcccc that should be replaced with qqq. 
Notice, unbelievably, and extraordinarily, longwords like супердлинноеслово and необыкновенное which ends with е. 
Do you think these sentences provide enough examples, or should we add more?
